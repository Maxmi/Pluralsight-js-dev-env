Notes I took following the Pluralsig course on JavaScript development environment setup.

1. Create .editorconfig file in the root of the project.  
2. Create package.json file
3. Create npm scripts:
- "prestart" - will always run before npm start  
- create script for security check and for sharing your work in progress(via localtunnel or alike)  
- we can have scripts that will run in parallel(npm run all)  
- and even will open an app in dev mode as well as for sharing at the same time  
-
